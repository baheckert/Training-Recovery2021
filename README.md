# Training-Recovery2021
Mashup of metrics relating to my training, heart rate, and Garmin stress score

I'm interested in finding metrics to watch to get an idea of how rested and fresh I am for racing. I would like to have an idea of how I will perform based on how hard I've been training and whether I have been recovering successfully from the training. I would then like to find ways to maximize training without negatively affecting my performances.
